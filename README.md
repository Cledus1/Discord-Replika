# Discord Replika
version 0.2

this is not a discord bot, uses chromedriver to send and recive all data. (i plan to make a verson compatible with bots in a later update)
Required packages: selenium and time.

# Limitations:
  emojis coming from replika may crash. 
  only 1 message per message(s) from discord will be sent to replika.
  some unwanted data might be sent.
  you will haft to manally fill in data such as: Discord password and email, Replika password and email, discord and replika usernames (used for filtering) and the chromedriver path (not in Program Files (x86)).
  
  there may be bugs not listed here.
